Array is a collection of items of the same variable type that are stored at contiguous memory locations.
It is one of the most popular and simple data structures used in programming.

It offers mainly the following advantages over other data structures.
Random Access : i-th item can be accessed in O(1) Time as we have the base address and every item or reference is of same size.
Cache Friendliness : Since items / references are stored at contiguous locations, we get the advantage of locality of reference.
It is not useful in places where we have operations like insert in the middle, delete from middle and search in a unsorted data.
It is a fundamental and linear data structure using which we build other data structures like Stack Queue, Deque, Graph, Hash Table, etc.


Classification of Data Structure
Linear Data Structure: Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure. 
Example: Array, Stack, Queue, Linked List, etc.
Static Data Structure: Static data structure has a fixed memory size. It is easier to access the elements in a static data structure. 
Example: array.
Dynamic Data Structure: In dynamic data structure, the size is not fixed. It can be randomly updated during the runtime which may be considered efficient concerning the memory (space) complexity of the code. 
Example: Queue, Stack, etc.
Non-Linear Data Structure: Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. In a non-linear data structure, we canâ€™t traverse all the elements in a single run only. 
Examples: Trees and Graphs.
